# Sessions and usage: what the node is paid on

A session is paid on the chain; the node serves it and reports its usage with
`MsgUpdateSession`. Breaking these rules either costs the operator earnings (usage not
reported, a report refused) or gives clients service nobody pays for. IDs as in
`test/README.md`.

- **[SL-1] Every service reports each peer under the key the node stored:
  `base64(peer data)`.** The usage job looks rows up by that key; a peer reported under
  any other key is treated as unknown, and its usage is never reported.
- **[SL-2] The totals the node stores and reports are what the chain held when the peer
  was admitted plus what the service counted since.** A session outlives a node restart
  and the service's counters start again from zero, while the chain refuses a report
  lower than the last one. The reported duration is built the same way.
- **[SL-3] Usage that moved in either direction is stored.** A pass that sees only the
  download grow still stores it, reports it and checks the allocation.
- **[SL-4] Admission is checked and recorded under one lock, which the jobs share.**
  Concurrent handshakes cannot together exceed `max_peers`, and one session or one key
  is never admitted twice, not even by a retrying client or a replay.
- **[SL-5] A peer whose session row cannot be written is removed again.** A peer without
  its row would be served unmetered until the next pass.
- **[SL-6] Only an active session of this node, held by the signing account, is
  admitted.** The chain is asked for the session; a missing or inactive session, another
  account's or another node's is refused. A plan subscription must be active and the
  account must hold an allocation on it.
- **[SL-7] Admission enforces the session's byte cap and the plan allocation.** The
  allocation counts what this node has served on it but not yet reported, so a client
  can't start session after session on usage the chain hasn't seen yet.
- **[SL-8] An account has one peer at a time.** A new handshake from the account evicts
  its earlier peer.
- **[SL-9] A connected peer the node holds no session for, or that has used its
  allocation, is removed.**
- **[SL-10] A session the chain has ended loses its peer, and its row once the chain
  marks it inactive.** A session the chain cannot be asked about waits for the next
  pass; the rest of the pass goes on.
- **[SL-11] One session the chain refuses does not hold back the other reports.** The
  chain fails a whole transaction for one bad message (a session deleted between the
  query and the send), so the batch is checked again and resent without it, and then
  one session at a time. During an RPC outage the batch waits for the next pass instead.
- **[SL-12] A failed job pass never stops the node.** An RPC outage or a daemon that
  doesn't answer is logged and retried at the next tick; stopping would cut every
  client's tunnel and restart the node into the same outage. A job that panics hands an
  error to the node, which then stops the service cleanly (see [RT-2]).
- **[SL-13] The node reports at least as often as the chain requires.** The chain
  deactivates a node, and ends a session, whose last update is older than its
  `status_timeout`; whatever the operator configured, the update intervals never exceed
  80% of it.
- **[SL-14] A restart doesn't strand clients.** Session rows left by the previous run
  point at peers that no longer exist and would make a reconnect fail with 409. At start
  the node reports what those sessions moved that the chain doesn't have yet (if they
  are still active), then clears the table.
- **[SL-15] A usage update writes both columns, zero included.** A struct update skips
  zero values, which would leave an old figure in place.
- **[SL-16] A removed peer is cut off at once and can't come back.** OpenVPN kills the
  client's connection and denies its reconnect; Hysteria kicks it; WireGuard and the
  other proxies drop the peer.
