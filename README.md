`dvpnd` is an open source dVPN node daemon for the Sentinel blockchain (chain ID
`sentinelhub-2`). It registers the node on-chain, serves WireGuard or V2Ray sessions to
subscribers, and reports usage. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and is not
affiliated with Sentinel or Nordic DApps Inc. — see the provenance section below.

## Status

Speaks the current chain protocol: `sentinelhub` v12 message set (node/session/subscription
v3) on cosmos-sdk v0.47, implemented against the Apache-licensed chain sources only; see
`CONTRIBUTING.md` for the rules that keep it that way.

Verified end-to-end on the live network (`sentinelhub-2`) with a WireGuard node behind NAT
and the client side driven by `tools/e2e`, which handshakes the way current client apps do:
node registration, status keep-alive, session purchase, the `GET /` and `POST /` handshake,
tunnel traffic both ways, and usage reporting that the chain recorded.

Also verified in Docker: the image built from `Dockerfile` ran the node with every capability
dropped except the four WireGuard needs; a client in a second container bought a session,
tunnelled through the node with its traffic leaving under the node's public address, and the
chain recorded the usage the node reported. The run command is in `docs/operator.md`, section 7.

Protocols: WireGuard, AmneziaWG (WireGuard with obfuscation), OpenVPN, V2Ray (VMess), XRAY
(VLESS over TLS or REALITY, with Vision) and Hysteria2 (QUIC, optional Salamander
obfuscation), one per node, chosen with `[node] type`; `docs/protocols.md` records what each
needs and the node-to-client contract. An AmneziaWG node offers the parameter set every
client app speaks today and, on a second interface, an opt-in AmneziaWG 3.1 tier for
clients that ask for it. The XRAY, Hysteria2, AmneziaWG and OpenVPN services
were driven against the real binaries: peers added and removed through their control
interfaces, the protocol's own client tunnelled traffic through the node (for AmneziaWG and
OpenVPN between two containers, the latter over UDP and TCP), a wrong Hysteria2 password
was refused, a kicked Hysteria2 client lost its connection, a removed OpenVPN client was
killed and denied on reconnect, and the per-peer counters the node reports moved
accordingly.

Not yet exercised: V2Ray nodes, sessions for the four new protocols bought on the live
network, hourly and plan-subscription sessions, and a connection from a stock client app
(`lite/live_test.go` covers read-only queries, opt-in via `DVPND_LIVE_RPC`).

The node adapts its update cadence to the chain: it never lets `interval_update_status` or
`interval_update_sessions` exceed 80% of the chain's `status_timeout` parameters (currently
1 h and 2 h), because the chain deactivates a silent node and cancels a silent session.

## Node API

Clients talk to the node over HTTPS on `remote_url` (self-signed certificate; clients pin it).

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Node document: `service_type` (the protocol name), `service_metadata` (the protocol's public inbound description), `version{name: "dvpnd", tag, commit}`, location, measured or declared bandwidth and peer count. Every response also carries a `Server: dvpnd/<version>` header. |
| `POST` | `/` | Handshake used by current client apps. Body `{data, id, pub_key, signature}`: `data` is the base64 peer request (`{"public_key"}` for WireGuard, `{"uuid"}` for V2Ray), `pub_key` is `secp256k1:` + base64 compressed key, `signature` the compact signature over the 8-byte big-endian session id followed by the raw `data` bytes. Returns `{result:{data, addrs}}` with `data` = base64 JSON of the client configuration (WireGuard: `addrs` assigned to the client and `metadata[{port, public_key}]`; V2Ray: `metadata[{port, proxy_protocol, transport_protocol, transport_security, tls_pin}]`). |
| `GET` | `/status` | Legacy status document. `bandwidth` carries `download`, `upload` (bytes per second) and `source`: `speedtest` (measured), `config` (declared by the operator) or `none`. `location` carries `city`, `country`, `country_code` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), `latitude`, `longitude` and `source`: the service that geolocated the node's IP, `static` when the operator set values by hand, or `none`. |
| `POST` | `/accounts/:acc_address/sessions/:id` | Legacy handshake (`{key, signature}`, signature over the session id, verified against the account's on-chain public key). Off unless `[node] legacy_handshake = true`: the signature does not cover the key, so a captured request can be replayed. |

Errors are `{success:false, error:{code, message}}`; a session or key that already
exists answers `409`.

## Running a node

See [`docs/operator.md`](docs/operator.md): host requirements (a public IPv4 — not behind
carrier-grade NAT), build, configuration, TLS, firewall, the systemd unit in
[`scripts/dvpnd.service`](scripts/dvpnd.service), and day-to-day operation.
[`scripts/install.sh`](scripts/install.sh) does all of that on a Debian or Ubuntu host, VPS
or at home, in one run.

## Build

```sh
make build            # ./bin/dvpnd  (needs Go ≥ 1.26, gcc for sqlite)
./bin/dvpnd --help
```

`go install` does not work for this module and never has: the Cosmos stack requires three
`replace` directives in `go.mod` (a CometBFT fork among them), and Go refuses
`go install pkg@version` for any module whose `go.mod` replaces something. Build from
source, which is also what stamps the version and commit the node reports.

The module path is `github.com/trinitystake/dvpnd/v9`, carrying the major version as Go
requires from v2 upwards, so packages here can be imported by other modules:

```sh
go get github.com/trinitystake/dvpnd/v9@latest
```

Configuration lives in `~/.dvpnd/config.toml` (`dvpnd config init`). Existing installs of
the upstream node keep their data in `~/.sentinelnode`; `dvpnd` does not move it — it logs
a hint and you copy the directory when you are ready.

## Provenance and license

This repository is a fork of [`sentinel-official/dvpn-node`](https://github.com/sentinel-official/dvpn-node)
(GitHub repository id 193683313, since renamed `sentinel-official/sentinel-dvpnx`), taken at commit
[`62bde16ac4ac1135a61ce3e254973f7567d4c593`](https://github.com/sentinel-official/sentinel-dvpnx/commit/62bde16ac4ac1135a61ce3e254973f7567d4c593)
of **2024-01-25** — the last commit upstream published under the **Apache License 2.0**.
The very next upstream commit (`99603eff`, 2024-03-31) replaced that license with a
non-open-source one. **No code, configuration or documentation from that commit or any later
upstream commit is included here.** The Apache 2.0 grant on everything before it is perpetual
and irrevocable (License §2), which is what makes this fork possible.
